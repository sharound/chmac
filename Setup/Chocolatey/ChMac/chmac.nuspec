    <tags>ChMac Utility Network Security Wi-Fi MAC Address Networking Windows Batch Scipt Command CLI</tags>
    <summary>A quick Windows batch CLI tool to change or randomize network adapter MAC address for security, or to work around usage limit of public Wi-Fi hotspots, either auto or manually. The command, chmac, changes MAC address in an easy-to-use interactive console alongside CLI parameters</summary>
    <description>## ChMac - Windows Command to Change MAC Addresses of Network Adapters (chmac.bat)

Named after getmac and chmod, `chmac` is a command-line-interface (CLI) tool for Windows that changes or randomizes MAC addresses of specified network adapters, e.g. for a client device to reuse public Wi-Fi hotspot that has exceeded usage limit for the day (e.g. hotels, restaurants), or to enhance security.

An easy-to-use interactive console is available, alongside command-line parameters, e.g. for scheduling jobs with Task Scheduler. ChMac also has built-in support for recurrence.

## List of Features

- Change MAC addresses on Windows automatically or manually
  - Automatically change MAC addresses on set intervals
    - Useful to reconnect to free public Wi-Fi hotspots that impose a time limit by recognizing MAC addresses to prevent the same device from reconnecting
- Randomize MAC addresses for better security using public Wi-Fi
  - Generate new MAC addresses randomly based on a customizable list of organizationally unique identifiers (OUI)
- Optionally leverage DevCon.exe to simply the process by automatically disabling and re-enabling network interface card (NIC)
  - ChMac also works without DevCon by showing the Network Connections folder when finished, so that users can manually disable and re-enable NIC for new settings to take effect
  - On first launch, users are guided to download DevCon with convenient automatic and manual options
- Restore original MAC address
- Error checking and rich return codes for scripting and other possibilities
- Free and open-source software written in Windows batch language
- Supports Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10 and Server 2000/2003/2008/2012/2016/2019
- Portable by default. Optional installer enables `chmac` command globally (in Command Prompt and Run prompt. For PowerShell prompt, the command would be `chmac.bat`)
- Easy-to-use interactive console as well as accepting command-line parameters
  - Just follow instructions on screen for using the interactive console. For command-line mode, see the following

## How It Works

ChMac works by querying a list of network adapters from Windows registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}`.

Based on user selection, ChMac updates the registry key responsible for the MAC address, `NetworkAddress`, of the corresponding adapter with an inputted or randomized MAC address from customizable OUI lists, either ad-hoc or automatically with Task Scheduler or its built-in auto-changing mechanism.

After MAC address is updated, the network adapter will be automatically disabled and re-enabled if an OS-specific DevCon.exe (a separate download from Microsoft) is available in the OS (the environmental variable, `PATH`) or under ChMac dependency directory, `ChMac\Data\3rdparty`.

If DevCon is unavailable, the Network Connections window will be presented to user where network adapter can be disabled and re-enabled manually.

## Syntax

chmac.bat `[/d dir][/l][/m address][/n id][/r][/help][/?]`

## Parameters

```
/d dir        :: working directory - maybe required
                 (MUST be specified before other parameters)
/l            :: list network adapters and their IDs
/m            :: new mac address to be applied.
/n            :: adapter to be applied new mac address if /m is unspecified
                 new mac address will be randomized (OUI kept) and automatically filled in
/r            :: restore to original MAC address
/a            :: auto-change interval
                 suffix may be s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours or d for days
                 e.g. enter '20m' to recur every 20 mins. [X] to reset or exit
```

When no parameter is specified, interactive mode is entered on launch.

## MAC Address Format
  
The MAC address format can be any of the following:

```
AB-CD-EF-12-34-56
AB:CD:EF:12:34:56
AB.CD.EF.12.34.56
AB CD EF 12 34 56            :: without any separation in between at all
```

**Note**: To increase success rate of changing MAC addresses in Windows Vista and later OS, the OUI lists included in ChMac contains MAC addresses which starts with `02` only

## Examples

### Command-Line Mode

```
chmac /l                     :: list available adapter IDs
chmac /n 1                   :: update network adapter #1 with randomized mac address numbers
chmac /m 00301812AB01 /n 2   :: update network adapter #2 with the new mac address: 00-30-18-12-AB-01
chmac /n 3 /r                :: restore adapter 3 to its original MAC
chmac /n 4 /a 20m            :: auto-change MAC per 20 minute
chmac /?                     :: shows short help. [/help] for long
```

### Interactive Mode

Simply run `chmac.bat` and follow on-screen instructions.
